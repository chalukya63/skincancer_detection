                This web app uses computer vision to identify the three highest
                probability diagnoses for a skin lesion. A more advanced version
                could be used to identify cancerous skin lesions early.

                <span class="w3-text-teal"
                  >Melanocytic nevi, commonly known as moles, are benign proliferations of melanocytes (pigment-producing cells) in the skin. They can appear anywhere on the body and vary in size, shape, and color. Most moles develop in childhood or adolescence, but new ones can appear later in life.</span

                  >Melanoma is an aggressive skin cancer originating from melanocytes, the pigment-producing cells in the skin. It is highly dangerous due to its potential to metastasize if not detected early. The main types include superficial spreading melanoma (SSM), the most common form, growing horizontally before invading deeper layers; nodular melanoma (NM), a fast-growing, raised lesion prone to ulceration; lentigo maligna melanoma (LMM), a slow-growing variant often found on sun-damaged skin; acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM), which appears on the palms, soles, or under nails and is more common in darker skin tones; and amelanotic melanoma, which lacks pigmentation and is harder to diagnose. Risk factors include excessive UV exposure, fair skin, a history of sunburns, a family history of melanoma, multiple or atypical moles, and a weakened immune system..</span

                <b>Benign keratosis</b><br />
                <span class="w3-text-teal"
                  >Benign keratosis refers to a group of non-cancerous skin growths caused by excessive keratin production in the epidermis. The most common type is seborrheic keratosis (SK), which appears as waxy, wart-like growths in various shades of brown or black, often resembling stuck-on patches. Another type, solar (actinic) keratosis (AK), results from chronic sun exposure and is considered precancerous, presenting as rough, scaly patches that may develop into squamous cell carcinoma if untreated. Lichen planus-like keratosis (LPLK), sometimes mistaken for melanoma, appears as a pink or inflamed lesion that evolves from seborrheic keratosis. Stucco keratosis, a variant found on the lower legs and feet, consists of small, dry, white or gray keratotic growths. While these conditions are generally harmless, distinguishing them from malignant lesions is crucial, and advanced skin imaging, such as UV-based analysis, can aid in accurate diagnosis.</span

                <b>Basal cell carcinoma</b><br />
                <span class="w3-text-teal"
                  >Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common type of skin cancer, arising from the basal cells in the epidermis due to prolonged UV exposure. Although slow-growing and rarely metastatic, it can cause local tissue destruction if untreated. BCC often appears as a pearly or waxy bump, a pinkish patch, or a non-healing ulcer with rolled edges, commonly on sun-exposed areas like the face, neck, and hands. Variants include nodular BCC (raised and shiny), superficial BCC (red, scaly, and eczema-like), and morpheaform BCC (scar-like and aggressive). Risk factors include fair skin, excessive sun exposure, aging, and a history of skin cancer. </span

                <span class="w3-text-teal"
                  >Actinic keratoses (AK) are precancerous skin lesions caused by chronic sun exposure, often found on sun-exposed areas like the face, scalp, ears, and hands. They appear as rough, scaly, red or brown patches that may feel like sandpaper and can sometimes itch or become tender. While AKs themselves are benign, they have the potential to progress into squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) if left untreated. People with fair skin, frequent sun exposure, or a history of sunburns are at higher risk..</span

                <b>Vascular skin lesions</b><br />
                <span class="w3-text-teal"
                  >Vascular skin lesions are abnormalities involving the blood vessels in the skin, ranging from benign birthmarks to potentially serious conditions. They include hemangiomas, which are common in infants and appear as red or purple raised growths due to abnormal blood vessel proliferation, and port-wine stains, congenital capillary malformations that cause flat, reddish discoloration, often on the face. Spider angiomas and cherry angiomas are small, dilated blood vessels that can develop with age or hormonal changes. More serious vascular lesions include pyogenic granulomas, which are rapidly growing red nodules prone to bleeding, and venous lakes, dark blue papules commonly found on sun-exposed areas like the lips. While most vascular lesions are harmless, some may indicate underlying conditions or require treatment, such as laser therapy, electrocautery, or surgical removal. Advanced UV and multispectral imaging can enhance the detection of subtle vascular changes, aiding in diagnosis and treatment planning.</span

                <span class="w3-text-teal"
                  >Dermatofibroma is a benign skin growth resulting from an overgrowth of fibroblasts in the dermis, often appearing as a firm, raised, or slightly depressed nodule with a brown, pink, or reddish hue. Commonly found on the legs, arms, or trunk, these lesions are usually small (0.5â€“1.5 cm) and asymptomatic, though they may be itchy or tender when pressed. A key diagnostic feature is the dimple sign, where the lesion retracts when pinched. Dermatofibromas are harmless and typically require no treatment unless they become bothersome, in which case they can be surgically removed. They are often mistaken for melanocytic nevi or other skin conditions, making UV and dermoscopic imaging useful for accurate differentiation..</span

              <p>The app accepts images in jpg or png format.</p>

              <p class="w3-text-pink topp-margin"><b>Limitations</b></p>

              <p>
                The Deep Learning model that powers this app is not skilled
                enough to consistently assign the highest score to the correct
                lesion. Although, the model is trained good enough to detect
                melanoma better than others, its still not that good to be used
                in real life. Also, during testing, the correct lesion was
                regularly among the top 3 predicted lesions.
              </p>

              <p>
                Note: The model was not trained using photos that were taken
                with a mobile phone. Therefore, the model's prediction accuracy
                could be affected by variations in the quality of mobile phone
                images.
